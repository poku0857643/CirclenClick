# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the extension icons in the following sizes:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Temporary Workaround

For development, you can:
1. Generate placeholder icons using any image editor
2. Use a service like https://www.favicon-generator.org/
3. Or create simple colored squares as placeholders

The icons should represent the CircleNClick brand:
- Color scheme: Blue (#4A90E2)
- Symbol: Circle with checkmark or magnifying glass
- Style: Modern, clean, professional

## Production

For production release, create proper icons with:
- High-resolution source (1024x1024)
- Transparent background (PNG)
- Consistent design across all sizes
- Optimized file sizes
